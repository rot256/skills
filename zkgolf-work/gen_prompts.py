To beat the baseline you must beat the MULTIPLICATIVE COMPLEXITY of chi itself: chi_i = a_i + a_{i+2} + a_{i+1}*a_{i+2} over GF(2).

TARGET: `Solution/{inst}/` contains a VALID, VERIFIED seed {goal} {framing}

Rewrite `main` (and helpers); set `@[reducible] def allocations` and `def constraints` to the true new cost; KEEP
+ re-prove EVERY required declaration: `main`, `elaborated`, `soundness`, `completeness`, `mainCost`, `isR1CS`, and
**`computableWitness`** (MANDATORY — the verifier runs `lean4export` over the config theorem list and ABORTS
(exit 134) if it is missing; never drop or rename it).

HARD REQUIREMENTS: do NOT change `Challenge/`; keep exact signatures; NO `sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`; permitted
axioms only (`propext`,`Quot.sound`,`Classical.choice`, the challenge `hCircomPrime`, and `Specs.*.hPrime` if the seed
uses it); `mainCost` proves `circuitCost main ⟨allocations,constraints⟩`; `isR1CS` holds; keep the build green.
If a full rewrite is too big, make the single highest-impact FULLY-PROVED reduction keeping all declarations.

MANDATORY SELF-VERIFICATION BEFORE RETURNING (a submission that only *looks* right but fails the real Lean build is
WORSE than no submission — it wastes a record attempt). You MUST, in your own environment:
  1. Run `lake build` on the full Solution and confirm it compiles with ZERO errors (warnings-as-errors too). Do not
     trust that edits compile — actually build them.
  2. Run `#print axioms main` (and for `soundness`,`completeness`,`isR1CS`,`computableWitness`) and confirm the printed
     axioms are a SUBSET of the permitted set above — in particular NO `sorryAx` and no newly-declared `axiom`.
  3. Confirm no `opaque`/trusted-predicate shortcut left a required theorem vacuously true or unprovable at the config layer.
If you CANNOT achieve a clean build + clean axioms at your target cost, DO NOT return the broken lower-cost attempt —
instead return the best solution you DID build and axiom-check successfully, even if its cost is higher (a verified
higher cost beats an unverified lower one). Never return code you have not compiled.
- FILE LIMIT: the zkGolf submission accepts at most 1000 .lean files (plenty of headroom). Splitting proofs across many focused modules is fine; do NOT contort the circuit to minimize file count. Optimize for LOWEST cost (allocations+constraints), not fewest files.
